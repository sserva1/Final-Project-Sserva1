# USHJA Zone 7 Show Facility Map
This webmap shows the locations of all USHJA approved show facilities in the states of Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Okalahoma, and Texas. 
The Hunter/Jumper sport is made up of two disciplines: Hunter and Jumper, also known as Show Jumping. Each year more than 1,000 US Equestrian-rated and countless other local Hunter/Jumper competitions take place across the country. Each show offers competition for riders of varying skill levels, and each offers Hunter, Jumper and Equitation classes. While Hunter and Jumper classes judge the horse, Equitation classes judge the rider.
